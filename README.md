# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! Here, you'll find my solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in C++, Python, and Java.

## Structure

The repository is meticulously organized into directories corresponding to different problem categories on LeetCode. Each category contains individual directories for each problem. Inside each problem directory, you'll discover three files: one for each language solution - C++, Python, and Java.

Additionally, each file contains a class `Solution` with a method implementing the solution to the respective problem.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**

git clone https://github.com/ShambhaviPandey2021/Leetcode.git
 

2. **Navigate to the directory of the problem you are interested in:**
   
cd Leetcode/CategoryName/ProblemName



3. **Review solutions in your preferred programming language:**

code ProblemName.cpp # C++
code ProblemName.py # Python
code ProblemName.java # Java


4. **Read through the solution implemented in the `Solution` class and experiment with your own test cases or LeetCode's test cases.**

## Contributions

Contributions are highly encouraged! If you have a more optimal solution or want to add a solution in a different programming language, feel free to create a pull request. Let's collaborate to enhance our problem-solving skills together!
